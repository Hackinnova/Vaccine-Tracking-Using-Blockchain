# VACCINE TRACKER USING BLOCKCHAIN #

Vaccine Tracker is a Decentralized E2E Logistics Application that stores the whereabouts of product at every freight hub on the Blockchain. At consumer end, customers can simply scan the QR CODE of products and get complete information about the provenance of that product hence empowering consumers to only purchase authentic and quality products.

COVID Vaccine Tracking using Blockchain.  Since the vaccine supply chain is so fragmented and complex there is a lack of visibility and there is no transparency(by visibility we mean the current condition[temperature] and location of the vaccine are unknown once they are shipped by the manufacturer) (by transparency we mean there is no clear traceability and chain of custody[ie. there is no chronological document that records the sequence of transfer and control of vaccines])

Since the government orders vaccines in bulk 1-2 million doses, so there is a chance of them getting expired or temp range in which vaccines should be kept is not maintained. This leads to vaccines being sold through back doors and introduction of counterfeit vaccines in the market.

About 30% of the Vaccines across the globe are wasted which costs us about 3 Billion USD$ each year.

As the vaccine moves through a lot of places throughout its journey from the manufacturer to the hospital, like various warehouses and airports, the basic idea is to record every step of the vaccine's journey in a blockchain.(Since the properties of Blockchain help overcome the problems faced in supply chain) The project is to be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, using smart contracts programmed in the solidity language.
